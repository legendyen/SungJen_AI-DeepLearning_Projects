Hi there!

Welcome to my portfolio, showcasing my projects in Deep Learning, Image Classification, and Natural Language Processing. 

This repository serves as a documentation of my journey through the fascinating world of AI and deep learning techniques. I've worked with various tools including Terraform, Keras, and PyTorch, applying them across different projects.

Feel free to explore and don't hesitate to leave comments or suggestions. I'm always looking for feedback to improve!
