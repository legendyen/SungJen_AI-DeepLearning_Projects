# Deep Learning for Image Classification

## Project Goal
This project aims to explore the concept of deep learning as it applies to image classification. We delve into neural network architectures, focusing on challenges like achieving local minima, and optimization techniques such as gradient descent and learning rate adjustments. The core objective is to enhance understanding and implementation skills in these areas.

## Tools Used
- **TensorFlow**: An end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning.
- **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow.

## Algorithms and Functions
### Activation Functions
- **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**: Utilized for robust, effective training.
- **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**: Known for its efficiency in handling sparse gradients on noisy problems.

### Loss Function
- **Sparse Categorical Crossentropy**: Used for multi-class classification tasks where the classes are mutually exclusive.

## Model Evaluation and Results
Our evaluation is based on the accuracy and loss metrics to assess the performance of our trained models. Detailed results and findings are documented, showcasing the effectiveness of the applied algorithms and tuning approaches.
